# Security policy

Thank you for your interest in improving the security of this project!

This code is not actively maintained, and probably has security bugs. It is a
"tech demo". :)

There are a number of [intentional limitations](./README.md#limitations) in this
software's design which deviates from "best practice" in order to simplify
things for a "tech demo".

This also probably uses old versions of software that has security bugs.

## Reporting

You can use GitHub's security tab to make a private report. Off-platform reports
are not accepted.

All reports must be written in English.

All reports must be verified by a human before submission and include some sort
of proof of concept exploiting the bug in _this_ project. Ideally, it should
include a patch that fixes the issue.

Properly triaging and investigating issues (not just security issues) takes
time, and this is not an actively maintained project.

Issues relating to external libraries and applications (including "you're using
an outdated version of Django that has 100 security bugs") are not accepted.

There are no bounties or payments on offer.

If you wish, we may credit you with discovery of the issue. The form of this
credit is at my personal discretion.
